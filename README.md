# Project Overview

This project includes a total of 6 UI designs created using React and TailwindCSS.

# Implemented Functionality: Timer

One of the key features implemented in this project is a Timer. The Timer is located in the "The Timer" section of the UI.

## Timer Features:

**Start/Pause**: The user can start and pause the timer at any moment.

##

**Reset**: The timer can be reset to 00:00.

##

**LocalStorage Integration**: The current state of the timer is stored in localStorage. This means that if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens the browser, the timer will continue from where it left off.
